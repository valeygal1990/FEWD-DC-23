## Intro To Programming Review

Note:
Syntax can always be looked up.  Programming is about solving problems.

---

## Syntax

__Syntax:__ Spelling and grammar rules of a programming language. 


Note:
Like with any language, there are formal rules around how to write it. This is the syntax.

---

## Javascript Syntax - Punctuation

*	Semicolon
*	Brackets
*	Parentheses
*	Quotation Marks

---

##JavaScript Syntax - Comments

```
// This is a single line comment in Javascript.

/* 
	This is a multi-line comment in Javascript.
	I can write as much as I want here.
*/
```

---

## jQuery Syntax

$

The Dollar Sign

---

## jQuery Syntax - Selectors

Selectors are just like CSS

	$(".class").hide();

---

## jQuery Syntax - Example

```
document.getElementById('thingy').onclick = doSomething;

function doSomething() {
	// make something happen here
}
```

In jQuery, this might look more like:

```
$('selector').click(doSomething);

function doSomething() {
	// make something happen here
}
```	
   	
Note: 
We will certainly be discussing this in more detail, but in general jQuery letâ€™s us grab some element from the page ($('selector')), and do something with it ($('selector').click(doSomething);). In this case, we grabbed an element with the id thingy and used .click() to make a function run when the user clicks on #thingy.
