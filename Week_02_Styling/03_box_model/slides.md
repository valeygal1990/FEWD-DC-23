## What is Git?

* A version control program that saves the state of your project's files and folders.  
* Kind of like a backup system, but with history.
* Designed to allow more than one person to work on the same project.

---

## Repository

(a.k.a. __repo__)

A central location where data (i.e. your project) is stored and managed.

---

## Clone

(a.k.a. __pull__)

Download your project (repository) to your local machine

---

## Commit

(a.k.a. __push__)

Save a version of your project to Git.

---

## GitHub

A platform that makes it easy to manage Git repositories. 

* Stores files like Dropbox or Google Drive - primarily code.
* Stores a history of files and the changes that happens within each changed document.
* Hosts files on the cloud so you can share the finished product with other people.

##Tags & Boxes

---

## Nested Selectors

A block inside a block (inside a block... etc).

Like Russian nesting dolls.

## Nested Selectors

---

## Default tag styles

Browsers have default styles for all HTML tags.  Yay!

_However_... they do not have the _same_ default styles. Boo!

So... now what?

---

## Normalize & Reset Files

CSS files that you include on your page to reset the CSS to look the same on _all_ browsers.

Note:
* Include these files _before_ your own CSS.
* Group discussion: Why would we want to do this?

---

## Normalize & Reset Files

* [Reset.css](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
* [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

Note:
* You only need one of these.
