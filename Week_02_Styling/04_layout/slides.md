## Review

We went through a whole lot of stuff on Tuesday, so let's review.

Note:
To Dos:
- Sync class repo!
- What is the box model?

---

## Class vs. ID

Let's review!  What's the difference?

Note:
- IDs are unique.  Only 1 per page.
- Classes are not unique.  Can have many on a page.

---

## Class vs. ID

When should you use them?

Note:
Go over best practices here!
- classes great for styles that will be reused.
- you want to reuse styles for consistency. 
- you also don't want to write a ton of code; more to maintain
- ids are great for very unique styles; usually only use ids for JS, though (later!)
