# FEWD Week #8: Bootstrap

---

## Description 

Modify your final project to use Bootstrap for responsive functionality and/or to add functionality via Bootstrap's components.

Alternatively, you can refactor the website code in the starter_code/ directory to use Bootstrap for the site's responsive functionality.  

Using these starter files, refactor the existing website code to use Bootstrap.

---

## Real-World Applications

- Use Bootstrap to add responsive elements to your website.
- Revisit applications and projects to iterate on and improve code you've written 

---

## Technical Requirements 

- Link the Bootstrap files to the webpage.
- As a user changes the size of a browser window:
  - Content remains visible to the user
  - Columns scale and collapse appropriately, using Bootstrap classes.
  - Navigation collapses appropriately, using Bootstrap classes

---

## Bonus

- Navigation collapses into a hamburger menu, using Bootstrap component.
- Addition of other Bootstrap components
